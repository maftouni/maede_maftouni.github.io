One Last Note for ALY3070

As we wrap up the semester, I want to leave you with one small but powerful suggestion.

You didn’t just learn tools this term, you learned how to think, design, and tell stories with data. Your final project reflects that, and it deserves a home beyond this class.

If you haven’t already, take a few minutes to publish a simple personal website and add your final project as your first portfolio piece. This is the kind of work employers want to see: real data, thoughtful design, and clear communication.

I’ve shared a short guide to help you deploy your site in just a couple of minutes. No pressure, no perfection, just a first step.

You’ve done meaningful work this semester. I hope you’re proud of it.
Wishing you a restful break and all the best ahead
